Grid Framework is constantly being worked on and most changes happen under the hood, so you don't notice them. However, there are times when I find myself regretting a choice or decision and where changing or removing the offending part is the only reasonable thing to do in the long run. This part of the documentation is here to list what changes were made and how to adapt your code. Note that this does not include things that were clearly broken and had to be fixed, so if there is a change not listed here it was a bug, not a feature.

\subsection*{Nearest\+Vertex/\+Face/\+Box }

In previous versions the results of {\ttfamily Nearest\+Face\+G} and {\ttfamily Nearest\+Box\+G} of rectangular grids, as well as {\ttfamily Nearest\+Vertex\+W} of hexagonal grids, had returned shifted values to give them whole numbers as coordinates. This was meant to make things simpler, but in reality it was just more confusing and made no real sense. In version 1.\+3.\+2 this was changed to normal, as one would expect. You can either change your code and subtract the extra shift, or you unzip the file G\+F\+Nearest\+Legacy.\+cs.\+zip found under under Plugins/\+Grid Framework/\+Legacy Support and append the letter L (for {\itshape legacy}) to the methods in {\itshape your} code (e.\+g. turn {\ttfamily Nearest\+Face\+G} into {\ttfamily Nearest\+Face\+G\+L}).

\subsection*{Vertex matrix }

Various methods for building and reading an array of Vector3 for storing vertices have been dropped in version 1.\+3.\+2. The methods were bloated and too specific, in most cases it was better to just write a custom solution for storing coordinates. They have been moved into extension methods, so if you want them back you must unzip the file G\+F\+Vertex\+Matrix\+Legacy.\+cs.\+zip, which can be found under Plugins/\+Grid Framework/\+Legacy Support.

\subsection*{Find\+Nearest\+Something and Get\+Something\+Coordinates }

The methods {\ttfamily Find\+Nearest\+Vertex/\+Face/\+Box} and {\ttfamily Find\+Nearest\+Vertex/\+Face/\+Box} have been renamed to {\ttfamily Nearest\+Vertex/\+Face/\+Box\+W} and {\ttfamily Nearest\+Vertex/\+Face/\+Box\+G} respectively in version 1.\+2.\+5. This was done in preparation for polar grids, which have two coordinate systems rather than one (hex grids at that point only had odd herringbone coordinates). The old methods are still present in name, but they will throw deprecation warnings when used. Run a simple search\&replace to fix it.
