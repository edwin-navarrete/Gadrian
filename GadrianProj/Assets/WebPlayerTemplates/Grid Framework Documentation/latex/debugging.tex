\subsection*{The Debug Sphere }

Under Grid Framework/\+Debug you will find a prefab called Debug Sphere. This prefab instantiates a small sphere with the script Grid\+Debugger attached. Just drop a grid onto the sphere, choose the function you want to debug, choose a plane if necessary and move the sphere around. You will see gizmo drawings and get values printed to the console for the function you have chosen.

\subsection*{Debug Scripts }

Under\+Component → Grid Framework → Debug you’ll find the script use for the sphere prefab as well as a script for debugging various conversions in polar grids.
