/*
	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script is used to simulate the behaviour a rotary dial found on old
telephones.  You could use these techniques to create interesting GUIs or
puzzles with spinning interfaces for the player.

We achieve the result by first deciding which sector was clicked and then using
the sector and the gird's angle to determine the total angle for the rotation.
The actual game logic can be nicely encapsulated in OnReachStop, solating it
from the rotation.
