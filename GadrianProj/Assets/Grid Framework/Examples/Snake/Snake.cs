/*
	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT

In the grid-based movement example I demonstrated how to move square by sqare.
Here it is taken one step further, an entire chain of objects are moved. we
store all segments (including the head) in a list and issue movement for all of
them in each turn. The head is moved manually and all other segments take the
psotion of their predecessor. The actual nake object is not moved at all,
instead it just manages the semgents.

This example demonstrates how a simple concept (moving from square to sqaure)
can be used to solve a problem that appears to be more complex. Instead of
moving each segment we just move the head and have the other egments follow it.
