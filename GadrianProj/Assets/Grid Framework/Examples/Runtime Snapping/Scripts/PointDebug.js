/*
	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script works similar to SnappingUnits, except instead of
aligning an entire Transform it aligns just a Vector3. You can
use this approach if you want more control over the point itself
instead of manipulatingt he Transform directly.

The scale variable decides whether to align to vertices or edges,
depending on whether the components are even or odd multiples
of the grid's spacing.

Make sure gizmos are turned on in the game view to see the results.
